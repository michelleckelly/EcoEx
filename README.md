### Welcome to EcoEx:
#### A catalog of ecological analysis R code examples with sample data sets

---

#### What I'm Doing

The goal of this project is to assemble a catalog of simple, reproducable, and easy to understand examples of how to effectively use R and packages to perform basic analysis of ecological data.

R is a statistical analysis language and programming environment for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux that is available freely from the CRAN network at https://cran.r-project.org/

#### Example 1. Stream Metabolism Calculations

The [StreamMetabolism](https://github.com/ssefick/StreamMetabolism) package can be used to calculate gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem production (NEP), and ecosystem respiration (ER) from single-station dissolved oxygen concentration data. It was developed by Stephen A Sefick Jr. (github user ssefick) and is available [on github here](https://github.com/ssefick/StreamMetabolism) with package manual [PDF located here.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/StreamMetabolism/StreamMetabolism.pdf)

#### For whom

This project will be most useful for biologists who are R novices and need a few stepping stones to transition to using R for all analysis purposes.
