## Welcome to EcoExamples in R!

#### What I'm Doing

The goal of this project is to create simple, reproducable, and easy to understand examples of how to effectively use base R and packages to perform basic analysis of ecological data. These examples can then be adapted with the user's own data.

R is a statistical analysis language and programming environment for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux that is available freely from the CRAN network at https://cran.r-project.org/

#### Stream Metabolism Example

The [StreamMetabolism](https://github.com/ssefick/StreamMetabolism) package can be used to calculate gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem production (NEP), and ecosystem respiration (ER) from single-station dissolved oxygen concentration data. It was developed by Stephen A Sefick Jr. (github user ssefick) and is available [on github here](https://github.com/ssefick/StreamMetabolism) with package manual [PDF located here.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/StreamMetabolism/StreamMetabolism.pdf)

#### For whom

This project will be most useful for biogeochemists who are R novices and need a few stepping stones to understand and use R for their primary analysis purposes.
