### | What |

The goal of this project is to assemble a catalog of simple, reproducable, and easy to understand examples of how to effectively use R and packages to perform basic analysis of ecological data.

R is a statistical analysis language and programming environment for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux that is available freely from the CRAN network at https://cran.r-project.org/

#### Example 1. Stream Metabolism Calculations

The [StreamMetabolism](https://github.com/ssefick/StreamMetabolism) package can be used to calculate gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem production (NEP), and ecosystem respiration (ER) from single-station dissolved oxygen concentration data. It was developed by Stephen A Sefick Jr. (github user ssefick) and is available [on github here](https://github.com/ssefick/StreamMetabolism) with package manual [PDF located here.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/StreamMetabolism/StreamMetabolism.pdf)

### | Who |

This project will be most useful for biologists who are R novices and need a few stepping stones to transition to using R for all analysis purposes. This idea began as a personal self-teaching project, so I'm also learning as we go along.

---

### | Where |

Ideally, the example data in this repo will come from real studies and may be "messy", so as to represent actual data that you would run for an analysis. It will be sourced from open repositories (such as USGS stream gauge data, available publicly at https://waterwatch.usgs.gov/) whenever possible.
