### What

The goal of this project is to assemble a catalog of simple, reproducable, and easy to understand examples of how to effectively use R and packages to analyze ecological data. 

R is a statistical analysis language and programming environment for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux that is available freely from the CRAN network at https://cran.r-project.org/

#### Example 1. Stream Metabolism Script

This script combines packages written by USGS and NEON to automatically pull discharge, stream depth, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and light data for a specified site and time from the relevant API. It then uses this data to model and plot gross primary productivity (GPP) ecosystem respiration (ER), and predicted dissolved oxygen concentrations.

### Who 

This project will be most useful for biologists who are R novices and need a few stepping stones to transition to using R for all analysis purposes. This repo began as a self-teaching project, so I'm also learning as we go along.

---

### Where

Ideally, the example data in this repo will come from real studies and may be "messy", so as to represent actual field data. It will be sourced from open repositories (such as USGS stream gauge data, available publicly at https://waterwatch.usgs.gov/) whenever possible.
